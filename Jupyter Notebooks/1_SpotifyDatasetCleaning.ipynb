                        A vision, a call In times before my fall In life before I became I dreamt I was insane  I saw the unseen I heard the unheard I rode the sky above the earth I felt the breeze of the world I walked along I should have retrieved What was real as a merry blue sky Was long gone within of me  Crimson tide Wave of lost time Scenario of a velvet blue sky I dreamt about day But I lived in the night I looked and I saw In my dream I was free Red turned blue White became black The daylight erased the shadow of me Insanity reached Whispering voice The sky above the stars The wind below the moon The light created shadows The dark beyond the eyes I sat before myself I looked above below  Doves and birds, grass and trees Where was all I used to see? Why am I not What I used to be? I embrace My living self  I see the unseen I hear the unheard I learned the secret But not before I learned  Night divide day, day erase night Light of day, day of darkness  That's the beauty of the mind They are inside my head Climbing the walls Falling off the ceiling Jumping on the floor Voices and calls And on the edge of sanity I stumble and fall  Through the gates of the endless halls  Soldier, walk with me Through the valley of eternity In passion I see Am I the one only the mirror sees? Through the valley of eternity Am I the one only the mirror sees? A distant call for me I am lost within my memory Lost in the maze The secret place that no one's ever seen I am lost within my memory The secret place that no one's ever seen Silent cries of despair Through the valley of eternity What sanity remains Within this fragile, twisted mind I am all alone Me, myself, and I Echoes pound my head Shapeless forms everywhere  I think, therefore I am You are a fantasy Made by me I dream this world When I end, the world will end with me I am everything You are me Sleep my child to never be  I fell asleep, to sweet lullaby A sleep in which I had a dream In this dream I conceived a perfect plan That would change the face of mankind  For it was my dream To create a perfect world From this cold imperfect world And all the answers were inside my mind And I was unafraid The dream was so enticing  Light of day, day of darkness  The soul of an angel Will live forever The love of the innocent Will last forever A moments passion I hear a desperate cry  I weep for the weak I pray for the strong But now I see it fate And I'm lying here alone  Through Crimson eye And shattered lie Behold the sacrifice Of innocent life  There`s blood on the bended knee The light paint a shadow on me Will I forsake you Or will I forsaken be?  I left my body Come meet me in my dreams It`s been so long Would you know me?  I see the unseen I heard the unheard I learned the secret But not before I learned  Time stands still, but I wonder Who is watching you Who is watching me  Will I forsake you Or will I forsaken me I am so lost but still I am so free  As a traveller I seek hospitality As a wanderer I seek immortality As a journey through insanity I seek divine comparity  Funeral Symphony Behind me, a dark shaping mass I turn and face, the face of deception A face without the warmth Of dignity and grace  In Twilight atmosphere A silent seductive call  Is summoning me  To my new world A brave new world Where right is wrong And justice is gone  I fell asleep, to sweet lullaby A sleep in which I had a dream In this dream I conceived a perfect plan That would change the face of mankind  For it was my dream To create a perfect world From this cold imperfect world And all the answers were inside my mind And I was unafraid The dream was so enticing  In this dream I conceived the perfect plan  I sit here alone, so cold Left in the dark, to feel Pity my soul What is left to say? What is left to see? Where did I fail?  Watch me and my new desire I am emptier than ever But I feel complete I conceil myself Until night falls I am who I am I just want to be  I hear a voice Who could it be? Is there anybody else here with me? Why do you torture me? Won't you leave me be?  Am I whom I should be? For all that you are lies only within of me  Out of reach, out of sight I feel strange and lost Can you lead me right? It's too dark for me to see Capture of soul Won`t you please forgive me?  Forgive me...  I heard the tales Of the secret way That tears are replacements For what has been taken away From us and the lost Still, all I see is burning fields Still, all I hear is dying screams  Am I who I should be? For all that you are Lies only within me  I am the future I am the past  I am what you wish for The god you wish to be  I am the voice Behind the silent scream  I am the dark And the light you'll never see  I am the blood That makes your soul free  I am pure I am unclean  It takes one to be a god It takes one to feel lonely  It takes two to outlast me It takes two to feel complete  It takes a moon to light the stars It takes a light to see the dark  Insanity reached Whispering voice The sky above the stars The wind below the moon The light created shadows The dark beyond the eyes I sat before myself  I looked above below   \n","437090

Servin' Alka-Seltzer Plus like it's rocks (Facts) Way too little to understand when they say it's slowing up the trap (Huh) Young nigga taking risks, I adapt (Let's go) Walked into a junkie, \"Where my money? You owe me\" (Get me my money) \"Young broke nigga, get my money, you owe me\" (Where my money?) \"Don't let the homies see you rockin' them new Rollies\" (Or what?) \"Or they gon' take it off you\" (Let's go) I've been on the block with the same moonrocks (Been on the block) Guess somebody got laid off (Ohh) Don't pick at no corn 'til they can't grow scrap Christmas trees, jingle bells down south (Ohh) I just wanna turn the road Like it's just some dice with every point one time (Ohh) Machine gun riding, man, you sure you wanna come? She suck it through the pocket, then I put it on her tongue (Ahh) I told 'em I was biased, and I'm never sipping rum (Hey) A hard time swallowing? I thought that it was yum (Apologize) I took it out her stomach, then I put it in her butt (Her butt) I took it out her momma, then I put it in her aunt (Her momma) I bought the bitch some water, then she took the shit to Flint (Some water) I told the bitch we gettin' it, and it will never ever end I told her that she's been my \"ever since\" ever since I told her I will never ever bring pink slips

Yes, cunt, that's a door I just want you to look at the door Now I'm a really positive person But you don't know what can happen from day to day As you think about it in your mind If I walked out that fucking door And the door closed And as it closed It slammed shut And no matter what you did No matter what you fucking did You could not open the door And you knew you could never look into my eyes again Hear my voice again Feel my touch again You're right, you know About that door You really shouldn't think about it A huge mistake to fucking think about You don't have to think about the door It makes you feel uncomfortable Doesn't it? I know it does You don't have to feel like that It's distressing It's really distressing  A terrible thing happened My friend was stabbed in the street By some drunk Dead before he arrived at the hospital Wouldn't it be terrible? Think about it Even if you could get that door opened And you were to search You could never find me again You will never be able to see me again You will never be able to hear my voice again Feel my touch again You'll never be able All that fun we had together The great times we had together The coast The night-time The hotel The journey home Even if you were to open that door You would search but you could never find You're nothing Cunt's nothing Zero Just remind yourself Remember you're fat Remember you're stupid Remember you're ugly Fat, stupid and ugly Just remember that And also remember life's tragedies Think about them I still think about it You see that door?

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder] Been thru the storm Through the cold and rain Everything's still the same Can't control how I feel Sometimes it's hard to keep it real You see the love of your life With the fortune and fame Like them Caddilacs with sun-roofs, man So many ways to make a Dollar, ha! Sometimes I think about my father You see my papa was broke and my momma was young Tryin' to blend in with dem city folk Everyday landlord knocking down the door  [Verse 1: Black Thought] Listen, everybody wanna be famous I don't give a... how funny the game is They want it if its gonna be painless They don't want it if it's gonna be strange Full of tunnels and changes I ain't gonna front Ask my five-year-old son what he want He said he want the world to know what his name is I said be smart, boy And told him he should follow his heart 'Cause if you trying to run from it, it's dangerous We living in a era where the people is shameless They gonna do whatever for the paper, you name it Some come up real smooth Anybody will try you Some wanna use you, some wanna be used by you Don't get it confused, yo That's the key to survival Choose your own view If you don't see it as I do But it's all substantial I'm telling you its of the handle That's the reason I'ma set an example I've been through...

Look, everybody wanna get nice But everything come at a price, right? Err'body got their own price That's something I learned When people too nice It's something that they want in return Nine times out of ten What they wanting is yearn Or they just a little concerned Of something to burn People talk about respect That's something that's earned People that don't wanna give it when they know it's deserved But it's real hot And that kinda life they want it now When the wheel starts spinning It's tough to slow it down, Black Wanna get the people involved And show em how If they don't wanna tell you the truth You know it now It's bout life ' Pressing in pursuit of that paper And people worldwide on their worst behavior And folks that was never really movers and shakers Getting anxious suddenly they wanna be gangsta But...

that I'm on is a tough one to swallow    I'm not a criminal not a role model    Not a born leader I'm a tough act to follow    I am not the fortune and the fame    Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game    I came in the ring like a dog on a chain    And found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems    And it seems ugly but it can get worse    Because even a blueprint is a gift and a curse    Because once you get a theory of how the thing works    Everybody wants the next thing to be like the first    And I'm not a robot. I'm not a monkey    I will not dance even if the beat's funky    Opposite of lazy, far from a punk    Stop talking and start trying to catch up motherfucker        And all the people say    Try and catch up motherfucker        Pac said money changes situation    Big said it increase the complication    Kane said don't step I ain't the one    Chuck said an uzi weighs a motherfucking tone    And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me    Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me        I'm awfully underrated but pay me to correct it    And so it ain't mistaken I'm gonna state it for record    I am the opposite of where I got this    A weak opposite, a slack sending them    A heat sending them    A crack closest to a peak    Far from a punk    Ya'll better start trying to catch up motherfucker        And all the people say    Try and catch up motherfucker        But when they come for me    Come for me, I'll be gone    But when they come for me    Come for me, I'll be gone    But when they come for me    Come for me, I'll be gone        And all the people say    Try to catch up motherfucker    And all the people say    Try to catch up motherfucker

All that remains in these hands Belongs to you  Even if I lose everything I still have something to offer Be it my future or my life itself My burned-out emotions, my unanswered prayers My miserable begging, my foolish giving My strained voice, my dirtied hands Even my ripped open heart  I have been wishing for nothing but your happiness Over and over  Even if everything I hold in these hands is lost As long as there is still time I will keep trying over and over again I don't care if it's meaningless and futile Even if the days I've spent would end in misery If my wishes change to curses Even if it was all in vain, I don't mind Only you remain in my eyes At the end of this dark road It seems as though any light would eventually die out If that is what is decided by fate  Rather than living by holding onto hope I sacrifice my all for the now  My burned-out emotions, my unanswered prayers My miserable begging, my foolish giving Whatever happens, I don't care I will give my all for you  Nothing would make me happier than If I could be with you forever   \n","95779

And the ones that trip us on the pavement  [Pre-Chorus] We're awake in this dream and we choose to believe That the you that's in me is in everything We're alive We're alive  [Chorus] It's who we are that keeps me believing There's something here bigger than ourselves If I'm wrong than why am I still feeling? Who we are keeps me believing [Verse 2] For the pain, for the strength For our will to hold on through the changes From the now ‘til the end, every second we count We embrace it  [Pre-Chorus] As our faces erase and our bodies decay As we move through the waves that echo our names We're alive We're alive  [Chorus] It's who we are that keeps me believing There's something here bigger than ourselves If I'm wrong than why am I still feeling? Who we are keeps me believing Keeps me believing  [Hook] One more time we stand together Never forget why; always remember One more time we stand together Always remember  [Bridge] It's who we are We make it out alive After all, it's down to you and I [Chorus] It's who we are that keeps me believing There's something here bigger than ourselves If I'm wrong than why am I still feeling? Who we are keeps me believing Keeps me believing  [Outro] It keeps me believing Who we are keeps me believing Keeps me believing Keeps me believing Keeps me believing   \n","203829

my heels down Atlantic Road  [Pre-Chorus] For retching poor girl's clothes They kept me safe when the world was cold It didn't matter they have worn them before I never wanted for anything more  [Chorus] When we were nothing, we had it all In your arms of love, you kept me warm It was all I wanted, all I wanted You gave me everything that you never had I think you're something that I wanna be With your arms of love wrapped around me I'm coming home, I'm coming home Cause you gave me everything that you never had [Post-Chorus] All I can do is try and give you something back You gave me everything that you never had  [Verse 2] You take my hand when I caught money You kiss it better, you heal me And even now, when it gets too much You're by my side, you pick me up  [Pre-Chorus] I'm retching second hand clothes They keep me safe when the world is cold It don't matter they have worn them before And I don't want for anything more  [Chorus] When we were nothing, we had it all In your arms of love, you kept me warm It was all I wanted, all I wanted Cause you gave me everything that you never had I think you're something that I wanna be With your arms of love around me I'm coming home, I'm coming home Cause you gave me everything that you never had [Bridge] We laugh, we cry, we get by And we gotta be strong We always gotta stay strong We struggle, we fight and we ride And we gotta be strong We always gotta stay strong  [Chorus] When we were nothing, we had it all In your arms of love, you kept me warm It was all I wanted, all I wanted Cause you gave me everything

bend, we will not be ashamed To turn, turn, will be our delight 'Til by turning, turning, we come round right  (Kathy Sobansky of Clam Chowder wrote second verse of:) \"tis a gift to be simple 'Tis a

Why am I not What I used to be? I embrace My living self  I see the unseen I hear the unheard I learned the secret But not before I learned  Night divide day, day erase night Light of day, day of darkness  That's the beauty of the mind They are inside my head Climbing the walls Falling off the ceiling Jumping on the floor Voices and calls And on the edge of sanity I stumble and fall  Through the gates of the endless halls  Soldier, walk with me Through the valley of eternity In passion I see Am I the one only the mirror sees? Through the valley of eternity Am I the one only the mirror sees? A distant call for me I am lost within my memory Lost in the maze The secret place that no one's ever seen I am lost within my memory The secret place that no one's ever seen Silent cries of despair Through the valley of eternity What sanity remains Within this fragile, twisted mind I am all alone Me, myself, and I Echoes pound my head Shapeless forms everywhere  I think, therefore I am You are a fantasy Made by me I dream this world When I end, the world will end with me I am everything You are me Sleep my child to never be  I fell asleep, to sweet lullaby A sleep in which I had a dream In this dream I conceived a perfect plan That would change the face of mankind  For it was my dream To create a perfect world From this cold imperfect world And all the answers were inside my mind And I was unafraid The dream was so enticing  Light of day, day of darkness  The soul of an angel Will live forever The love of the innocent Will last forever A moments passion I hear a desperate cry  I weep for the weak I pray for the strong But now I see it fate And I'm lying here alone  Through Crimson eye And shattered lie Behold the sacrifice Of innocent life  There`s blood on the bended knee The light paint a shadow on me Will I forsake you Or will I forsaken be?

I see the unseen I heard the unheard I learned the secret But not before I learned  Time stands still, but I wonder Who is watching you Who is watching me  Will I forsake you Or will I forsaken me I am so lost but still I am so free  As a traveller I seek hospitality As a wanderer I seek immortality As a journey through insanity I seek divine comparity  Funeral Symphony Behind me, a dark shaping mass I turn and face, the face of deception A face without the warmth Of dignity and grace  In Twilight atmosphere A silent seductive call  Is summoning me  To my new world A brave new world Where right is wrong And justice is gone  I fell asleep, to sweet lullaby A sleep in which I had a dream In this dream I conceived a perfect plan That would change the face of mankind  For it was my dream To create a perfect world From this cold imperfect world And all the answers were inside my mind And I was unafraid The dream was so enticing  In this dream I conceived the perfect plan  I sit here alone, so cold Left in the dark, to feel Pity my soul What is left to say?
