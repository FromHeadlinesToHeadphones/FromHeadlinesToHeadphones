Come forth!

At what cost do you think you'll be saved?  [Chorus] Don't use His name to move all the mountains in your way Go back from where you came, have heart with what you say  [Post-Chorus] You think you have all of the answers Don’t think you can judge, and not be judged No! [Verse 2] You use His name in vain You're a deceiver Open your ears and bite your tongue Now listen up  [Verse 3] Protest the funerals of the ones who protect you? Innocent men and women who have died to defend you Stop biting the hand that, feeds, consumed by all your own needs  [Pre-Chorus] At what cost will you be saved?  [Chorus] Don't use His name to move all the mountains in your way Go back from where you came, have heart with what you say  [Outro] You're a plague to the non-believer Tell them all \"You're gonna burn forever”!
